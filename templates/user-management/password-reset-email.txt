We heard that you lost your password for the Illinois Public Salary Database. Sorry about that!

But don’t worry! You can use the following link to reset your password:

{{ protocol}}://{{ domain }}{{ url('confirm', kwargs={'uidb64':uid, 'token':token}) }}

If you don’t use this link within 3 days, it will expire. To get a new password reset link, visit {{ protocol}}://{{ domain }}{{ url('reset') }}

Thanks,
Your friends at BGA
